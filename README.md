### Statement

Drina, a friend of yours who decided to invest in the drone renting business, has already bought a first high-end (and very expensive) drone. The renting process, which might seem very old-fashioned, was conceived to maximise the profit taking advantage of the fact that a drone with so many innovative features attracts lots of people. 
There is a period for customers to send their renting offers. A renting offer specifies a time interval and the price the customer is willing to pay for renting the drone during that time interval. As offers are secret and independent, they can often not be all compatible. So, when the offering period ends, Drina has to analyse carefully all offers in order to select those that will be accepted. Can you help her select a (compatible) set of offers that maximises her profit?
